            <p class="content-description thin-weight text-align-left">A Half-Baked Discussion is an informal event where people interested in understanding and improving our cities can share ideas, learn from each other, and co-create shared declarations on pressing urban topics. The objective is to move beyond talk and inspire action and unique collaborations.</p>

            <p class="content-title block extra-bold-weight text-align-left">Towards shared declarations</p>
            <p class="content-description thin-weight text-align-left">Half-Baked Discussions are organised around three pillars: definitions, values, and experiences. An interactive double-height wall, organised accordingly, comes alive during the discussion: ideas had and words uttered are written onto the wall, and voted on. The goal, ultimately, is to help participants move beyond their current frames of reference and develop a shared understanding of the topic at hand, a shared declaration.</p>

            <p class="content-description thin-weight text-align-left">Half-Baked Discussions start as a panel and end as a conversation. They start with a panel of practitioners and experts whose work touches on the topic at hand. Their reflections and opinions will serve to engage wider curiosity, catalysing contributions to the discussion.</p>

            <p class="content-title block extra-bold-weight text-align-left">Open, informal discussions</p>
            <p class="content-description thin-weight text-align-left">The guiding principle of Half-Baked Discussions is openness: openness to people with different backgrounds and experiences, openness to a diversity of perspectives, and openness to the possibility of change. Half-Baked Discussions are not intended to be a space for debate (though that is always welcome), but rather a space for open-minded exploration and collaboration.</p>
